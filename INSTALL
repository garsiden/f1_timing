F1.PL - INSTALL
===============

REQUIREMENTS
============

1.  Perl

Mac OSX and most Linux distributions will already have at least Perl 5.8
installed, which should be okay. The following additional modules are required:

    LWP::Simple
    HTML::LinkExtor
    Term::ReadKey
    DBD::SQLite

    To install a module run:

    perl -MCPAN -e "install 'Some::Module'"

Any additional dependencies a module may have will be installed first. 

For Windows users I would recommend Strawberry Perl as this already includes
the modules listed above. If you already have ActivePerl use the ppm package
manager to get the required modules.

2.  pdftotext

This is a small command line program from the Xpdf PDF file reader application
which will extract the text from a PDF file. Use the web page addresses below
to get a version suitable for your platform. Linux users can install the full
Xpdf application, or can just get the command line tools with apt:

        sudo apt-get install poppler-utils

3.  SQLite

This is a lightweight database used here to store the data extracted from the
PDF files. The necessary library files are installed by the Perl DBD::SQLite
module but the command line program is required to use the export functionality
of the script and is also useful for maintaining the database. For an
easy to install graphical interface, users with Firefox can get the SQLite
Manager add-on.

SETUP
=====

To tailor the script to your environment set the following constants in the
f1.pl script:

DOCS_DIR    - path to directory where the PDF files are to be saved
CONVERTER   - e.g., 'pdftotext' or the full path to the program if it's not
              located in your PATH environment variable
EXPORTER    - sqlite3, or full the path if necessary, e.g.,
              'C:\Program Files\sqlite3'

For Linux users, change the first line of the script to the path of your Perl
installation, and ensure that the script is executable, i.e.,

    chmod +x f1.pl

Windows users should run the script as 'perl f1.pl'.

For further help run 'f1.pl --man' to read the manual.
